# wirelessattackwork
just a repository for wireless attack directionaries and rules used with hashcat

This was just intended as a collection of tools and pointers I used in August of 2017 while looking for common patterns in home wireless equipment that was accessible to me. Some notes... centurylink by default uses 14 character pins that are extremely hard to brute force. netgear has patterns that are not. a large number of people use phone numbers apparently.. which bad as a 10 digit phone number (US) is easy to attack. 

some interesting links found in bookmarks.html
